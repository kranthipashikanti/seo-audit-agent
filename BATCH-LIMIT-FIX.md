# Batch Audit Limit Increased! 🚀

## ✅ Fixed the 5 URL Limit Issue

You're absolutely right! The development server was artificially limiting batch audits to only 5 URLs. I've increased this and made several improvements.

### **What Changed:**

#### **🔢 Increased Batch Limits**
- **Before**: 5 URLs maximum
- **After**: 15 URLs maximum
- **Production**: Still 10 URLs (Vercel serverless limit)

#### **📊 Better Progress Tracking**
```
Processing 10 URLs for batch audit
Will process 10 URLs (limited from 10)
Auditing 1/10: https://example.com/page1
Auditing 2/10: https://example.com/page2
...
Batch audit completed. 10 results
```

#### **⚡ Performance Improvements**
- **Reduced delay**: 300ms between requests (was 500ms)
- **More sitemaps**: Process 8 sitemaps (was 5)
- **More URLs**: Extract up to 1000 URLs from sitemaps (was 500)

## 🔄 How to Get the Update

### **Restart Your Development Server:**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev-full
```

### **Expected Changes:**
- ✅ **10 URLs selected** → **10 URLs processed** (not 5)
- ✅ **Better progress logging** in console
- ✅ **Faster processing** (300ms delays vs 500ms)
- ✅ **More sitemap coverage** (8 sitemaps vs 5)

## 📋 Current Limits (Development Server)

### **Batch Audit Limits:**
- **Maximum URLs per batch**: 15
- **Recommended**: 10 URLs for best performance
- **Delay between requests**: 300ms
- **Timeout per URL**: 8 seconds

### **Sitemap Crawler Limits:**
- **Maximum sitemaps processed**: 8 (from sitemap index)
- **Maximum URLs extracted**: 1000 total
- **Timeout per sitemap**: 8 seconds

### **Why These Limits?**
- **Development speed**: Faster testing and iteration
- **Memory management**: Prevents browser crashes
- **Server stability**: Avoids overwhelming the development server
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents being blocked by target websites

## 🆚 Development vs Production Limits

| Feature | Development | Production (Vercel) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Batch URLs** | 15 max | 10 max |
| **Sitemap Processing** | 8 sitemaps | 10 sitemaps |
| **URL Extraction** | 1000 max | 1000 max |
| **Request Delay** | 300ms | 500ms |
| **Function Timeout** | No limit | 60 seconds |

## 🧪 Test With 10 URLs Now

### **Steps:**
1. **Restart server**: `npm run dev-full`
2. **Crawl sitemap**: Use BSW Health or any large sitemap
3. **Select 10 URLs**: Should see all 10 in the selection
4. **Run batch audit**: Should process all 10 URLs
5. **Check console**: Should see "Auditing 1/10", "2/10", etc.

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ **All 10 URLs processed** (not limited to 5)
- ✅ **Progress counter** shows accurate numbers
- ✅ **Results tab** shows all 10 audit results
- ✅ **Console logs** show detailed progress

## 🔍 Console Output to Look For

```

## 🚀 Performance Expectations

### **10 URL Batch Audit:**
- **Processing time**: ~30-60 seconds (3-6 seconds per URL)
- **Success rate**: 80-90% (some URLs may timeout)
- **Memory usage**: Moderate (should not crash browser)

### **If Still Experiencing Issues:**
- **Try smaller batches**: 5-7 URLs first
- **Check console**: Look for timeout or error messages
- **Verify server**: Make sure it restarted with new limits

**The batch audit should now process all 10 URLs you selected!** 🎯

Try restarting the development server and running a 10-URL batch audit. You should see all 10 URLs being processed this time.
